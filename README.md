This is a web application that can generate mulitple visualizers to any song!
The javascript uses the Canvas API as well as the Web Audio API to display frequencies on screen.
Use the red green and blue sliders to change visualizer color or have it automatically change with the auto button.
All you need is an .mp3 file so feel free to uploade your favorite song and give it a shot.
